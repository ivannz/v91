title: Conformal stacked weather forecasting
abstract: In this paper we propose to apply the stacking method to aggregating multi-output
  predictions from different weather-forecasting domains (websites). Depending on
  the aggregating procedure (non-conformal/conformal), the results can be bare multi-output
  predictions or multi-output prediction regions. The experiments show the applicability
  of the stacking method on real data related to eight weather-forecasting domains.
