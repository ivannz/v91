title: Transfer learning for the probabilistic classification vector machine
abstract: Transfer learning is focused on the reuse of supervised learning models
  in a new context. Prominent applications can be found in robotics, image processing
  or web mining. In these fields, the learning scenarios are naturally changing but
  often remain related to each other motivating the reuse of existing supervised models.
  Current transfer learning methods are not well suited and used for sparse and interpretable
  models. Sparsity is very desirable if the methods have to be used in technically
  limited environments and interpretability is getting more critical due to privacy
  regulations. In this work, we show how transfer learning can be integrated into
  the sparse and interpretable probabilistic classification vector machine and it
  is compared with different standard benchmarks in the field.
