title: Venn predictors for well-calibrated probability estimation trees
abstract: Successful use of probabilistic classification requires well-calibrated
  probability estimates, i.e., the predicted class probabilities must correspond to
  the true probabilities. The standard solution is to employ an additional step, transforming
  the outputs from a classifier into probability estimates. In this paper, Venn predictors
  are compared to Platt scaling and isotonic regression, for the purpose of producing
  well-calibrated probabilistic predictions from decision trees. The empirical investigation,
  using 22 publicly available data sets, showed that the probability estimates from
  the Venn predictor were extremely well-calibrated. In fact, in a direct comparison
  using the accepted reliability metric, the Venn predictor estimates were the most
  exact on every data set.
