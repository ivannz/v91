title: Exchangeability martingales for selecting features in anomaly detection
abstract: 'We consider the problem of feature selection for unsupervised anomaly detection
  (AD) in time-series, where only normal examples are available for training. We develop
  a method based on exchangeability martingales that only keeps features that exhibit
  the same pattern (i.e., are i.i.d.) under normal conditions of the observed phenomenon.
  We apply this to the problem of monitoring a Windows service and detecting anomalies
  it exhibits if compromised; results show that our method: i) strongly improves the
  AD systemâ€™s performance, and ii) it reduces its computational complexity. Furthermore,
  it gives results that are easy to interpret for analysts, and it potentially increases
  robustness against AD evasion attacks.'
