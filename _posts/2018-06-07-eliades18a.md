title: Detecting seizures in EEG recordings using conformal prediction
abstract: This study examines the use of the Conformal Prediction (CP) framework for
  the provision of confidence information in the detection of seizures in electroencephalograph
  (EEG) recordings. The detection of seizures is an important task since EEG recordings
  of seizures are of primary interest in the evaluation of epileptic patients. However,
  manual review of long-term EEG recordings for detecting and analyzing seizures that
  may have occurred is a time-consuming process. Therefore a technique for automatic
  detection of seizures in such recordings is highly beneficial since it can be used
  to significantly reduce the amount of data in need of manual review. Additionally,
  due to the infrequent and unpredictable occurrence of seizures, having high sensitivity
  is crucial for seizure detection systems. This is the main motivation for this study,
  since CP can be used for controlling the error rate of predictions and therefore
  guaranteeing an upper bound on the frequency of false negatives.
