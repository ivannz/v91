title: Conformal feature-selection wrappers for instance transfer
abstract: In this paper we propose a new method of conformal feature-selection wrappers
  for instance transfer (CFSWIT). Given target and source data, the method optimally
  selects features and source data that are relevant for a classification model. The
  CFSWIT method is model-independent. It was tested experimentally for several types
  of classifiers. The experiments show that the CFSWIT method is capable of outperforming
  standard instance transfer methods.
