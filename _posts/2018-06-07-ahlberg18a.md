title: Using Venn-Abers predictors to assess cardio-vascular risk
abstract: This study investigates a method for predicting compound risk based on in
  vitro assay data and estimated $C_\textitmax$, the maximum concentration of a drug
  in the body. The method makes use of Venn-Abers predictors and Support Vector Machines
  to compute compound risk with respect to a biological target. The method has been
  applied to in vitro ion-channel data generated to assess cardiac risk and introduces
  a more intuitive way to reflect cardiac risk.
