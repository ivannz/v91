title: Venn-Abers predictors for improved compound iterative screening in drug discovery
abstract: Iterative screening, where selected hits from a given round of screening
  are used to enrich a compound activity prediction model for the next iteration,
  enables more efficient screening campaigns. The portion of the compound library
  that should be screened in each iteration is often arbitrarily decided. This is
  because no accurate information between screening size and the number of hits to
  be retrieved exists. In this article, a novel method based on Venn-Abers predictors
  was used to determine the optimal number of compounds to be screened in order to
  get a desired number of hits. We found that Venn-Abers predictors provide accurate
  information to support a reliable and flexible decision about the portion size of
  the compound library that should be screened in each iteration. In addition, the
  method exhibited great ability in producing an enriched subset in terms of hits
  and their diversity.
