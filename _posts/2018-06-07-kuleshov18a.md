title: Conformal prediction in manifold learning
abstract: 'The paper presents a geometrically motivated view on conformal prediction
  applied to nonlinear multi-output regression tasks for obtaining valid measure of
  accuracy of Manifold Learning Regression algorithms. A considered regression task
  is to estimate an unknown smooth mapping $\mathbff$ from $q$-dimensional inputs
  $\mathbfx ∈\mathbfX$ to $m$-dimensional outputs $\mathbfy = \mathbff(\mathbfx)$
  based on training dataset $\mathbfZ_(n)$ consisting of “input-output” pairs ${Z_i
  = (\mathbfx_i, \mathbfy_i = \mathbff(\mathbfx_i))^\textrmT, i = 1, 2, ..., n}$.
  Manifold Learning Regression (MLR) algorithm solves this task using Manifold learning
  technique. At first, unknown $q$-dimensional Regression manifold $\mathbfM(\mathbff)
  = {(\mathbfx,\mathbff(\mathbfx))^\textrmT∈\mathrmR^q+m: \mathbfx ∈\mathbfX ⊂\mathrmR^q}$,
  embedded in ambient $(q+m)$-dimensional space, is estimated from the training data
  $\mathbfZ_(n)$, sampled from this manifold. The constructed estimator $\mathbfM_\textMLR$,
  which is also $q$-dimensional manifold embedded in ambient space $\textrmR^q+m$,
  is close to $\mathbfM$ in terms of Hausdorff distance. After that, an estimator
  $\mathbff_\textMLR$ of the unknown function $\mathbff$, mapping arbitrary input
  $\mathbfx ∈\mathbfX$ to output $\mathbff_\textrmMLR(\mathbfx)$, is constructed as
  the solution to the equation $\mathbfM(\mathbff_\textrmMLR) = \mathbfM_\textMLR$.
  Conformal prediction allows constructing a prediction region for an unknown output
  $\mathbfy = \mathbff(\mathbfx)$ at Out-of-Sample input point $\mathbfx$ for a given
  confidence level using given nonconformity measure, characterizing to which extent
  an example $Z = (\mathbfx, \mathbfy)^\textrmT$ is different from examples in the
  known dataset $\mathbfZ_(n)$. The paper proposes a new nonconformity measure based
  on MLR estimator using an analog of Bregman distance.'
