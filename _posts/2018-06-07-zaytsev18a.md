title: Interpolation error of Gaussian process regression for misspecified case
abstract: 'An interpolation error is an integral of the squared error of a regression
  model over a domain of interest. We consider the interpolation error for the case
  of misspecified Gaussian process regression: a used covariance function differs
  from a true one. We derive the interpolation error for a grid design of experiments
  for an arbitrary covariance function. Then we consider particular types of covariance
  functions from theoretical and practical points of view. For $\textitMatern_1/2$
  covariance function poor estimation of parameters only slightly affects the quality
  of interpolation. For the most common covariance functions including $\textitMatern_3/2$
  and squared exponential covariance functions poor choose of parameters of covariance
  functions leads to a bad quality of interpolation.'
