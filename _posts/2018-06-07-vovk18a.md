title: Cross-conformal predictive distributions
abstract: Conformal predictive systems are a recent modification of conformal predictors
  that output, in regression problems, probability distributions for labels of test
  observations rather than set predictions. The extra information provided by conformal
  predictive systems may be useful, e.g., in decision making problems. Conformal predictive
  systems inherit the relative computational inefficiency of conformal predictors.
  In this paper we discuss two computationally efficient versions of conformal predictive
  systems, which we call split conformal predictive systems and cross-conformal predictive
  systems, and discuss their advantages and limitations.
