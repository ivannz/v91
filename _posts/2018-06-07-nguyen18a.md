title: 'Cover your cough: detection of respiratory events with confidence using a
  smartwatch'
abstract: Cough and sneeze are the most common means to spread respiratory diseases
  amongst humans. Existing approaches to detect coughing and sneezing events are either
  intrusive or do not provide any reliability measure. This paper offers a novel proposal
  to reliably and non-intrusively detect such events using a smartwatch as the underlying
  hardware, Conformal Prediction as the underlying software. We rigorously analysed
  the performances of our proposal with the Harvard ESC Environmental Sound dataset,
  and real coughing samples taken from a smartwatch in different ambient noises.
