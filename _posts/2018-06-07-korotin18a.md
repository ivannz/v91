title: Aggregating strategies for long-term forecasting
abstract: The article is devoted to investigating an application of aggregating algorithms
  to the problem of the long-term forecasting. We examine the classic aggregating
  algorithms based on the exponential reweighing. For the general Vovk’s aggregating
  algorithm we provide its probabilistic interpretation and its generalization for
  the long-term forecasting. For the special basic case of Vovk’s algorithm we provide
  two its modifications for the long-term forecasting. The first one is theoretically
  close to an optimal algorithm and is based on replication of independent copies.
  It provides the time-independent regret bound with respect to the best expert in
  the pool. The second one is not optimal but is more practical (explicitly models
  dependencies in observations) and has $O(\sqrtT)$ regret bound, where $T$ is the
  length of the game.
