title: Conformal prediction in learning under privileged information paradigm with
  applications in drug discovery
abstract: This paper explores conformal prediction in the learning under privileged
  information (LUPI) paradigm. We use the SVM$+$ realization of LUPI in an inductive
  conformal predictor, and apply it to the MNIST benchmark dataset and three datasets
  in drug discovery. The results show that using privileged information produces valid
  models and improves efficiency compared to standard SVM, however the improvement
  varies between the tested datasets and is not substantial in the drug discovery
  applications. More importantly, using SVM$+$ in a conformal prediction framework
  enables valid prediction intervals at specified significance levels.
