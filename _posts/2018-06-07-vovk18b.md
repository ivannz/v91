title: Conformal predictive decision making
abstract: This note explains how conformal predictive distributions can be used for
  the purpose of decision-making. Namely, a major limitation of conformal predictive
  distributions is that, at this time, they are only applicable to regression problems,
  where the label is a real number; however, this does not prevent them from being
  used in a general problem of decision making. The resulting methodology of conformal
  predictive decision making is illustrated on a small benchmark data set. Our main
  theoretical observation is that there exists an asymptotically efficient predictive
  decision-making system which can be obtained by using our methodology (and therefore,
  satisfying the standard property of validity).
